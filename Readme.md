# Yocat

Yocat project crawls media attachments from SNS and makes image recognition through an ML service (YOLO v3 to be specific) to detect if cats and dogs exist in the media content, then do a simple repost if it does.

This is a re-written of the original Yocat for Fanfou project and aims to building a general pipeline that can crawl from various SNS platforms.
